# What it takes to get this working on windows

1. Install the software
2. During installation you will be asked if you wish to install the driver
   from Atmel. Click Install.
3. Plug your keyboard in, press RESET
4. Wait while windows tries to find a driver in Windows Update. You can
   tell it to skip this but you'll still wait 5-10 minutes while it
   searches Windows Update.
5. Run Firmware Flasher
